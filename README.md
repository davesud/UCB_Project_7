Employee Database Analysis:
- The purpose of this project is to do an analysis of the employees database of Pewlett-Hackard and find info relating to amount of employees retiring per title and to find info on employees that are available to enroll in the mentorship program.
Summary:
I was running into some issues running the code so I don't actually have any results sadly.
